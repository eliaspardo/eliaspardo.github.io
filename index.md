## What I Do

I design and build quality engineering systems — not just tests. CI/CD-integrated pipelines, evaluation frameworks for AI systems, contract testing, and the infrastructure that makes quality a first-class concern in software delivery.

## Currently Building

An automated AI evaluation system for RAG-based chatbots using DeepEval and MLflow — reducing evaluation cycles from 4 hours to 30 minutes. Also exploring a microservices-based RAG Chatbot as a vehicle for AI-powered testing research.
