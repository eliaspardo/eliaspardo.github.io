Quality Engineering with 15+ years across Video, VR/MR and Sustainability spanning hands-on automation, CI/CD pipeline work and small-team leadership.

As a system-thinker I've always gravitated towards building automation frameworks, improving pipeline reliability, creating integration test environments and I'm now deliberately deepening that focus. Currently on a sabbatical exploring the impact of AI in QE, with a focus on building Quality Systems, testing AI-powered apps and using AI for test augmentation.
